    "\n",
    "**Chosen Research Domain:** Technology/Innovation Research Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this domain?**  \n",
    "I chose Option 2: Technologies/Innovations because I am interested in how new technologies are transforming the financial sector and creating both opportunities and risks. Within this domain, I focus on the subfield of Fraud Prevention and Detection Technologies, as they closely align with my career interests in digital finance and risk management. I am especially interested in understanding the evolution of these technologies.\n",

    "**Cohesion**\n",
    "The seven articles include the general article Fraud, which provides an overview of the concept. Credit Card Fraud, Internet Fraud, and Phishing illustrate key fraud techniques. Meanwhile, Multi-factor Authentication, Data Analysis for Fraud Detection, and Regulatory Technology present modern prevention and detection technologies. Together, these articles are closely related and collectively address questions such as: “How did these technologies evolve?”, “What were the key innovations?”, and “Who were the major contributors?”"

    "- Fraud is concentrated in e-commerce and online shopping transactions, but with increasing digitalization, more phishing techniques have emerged, such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) phishing, QR code phishing (Quishing), and Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) phishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rise of Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) may indicate that fraud has already become industrialized and commercialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anti-fraud techniques are also evolving, such as the adoption of AI/ML for real-time analytics and geolocation in fraud detection, and the use of multi-factor authentication (security tokens, authenticator apps, biometrics, and dynamic passcodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, several major challenges remain:\n",
    "\t1.\tFraud techniques are evolving rapidly, while anti-fraud measures are often updated only after new types of fraud are discovered.\n",
    "\t2.\tFraud detection relies heavily on large datasets to improve accuracy, but faces three challenges: privacy protection, data gaps, and high false-positive rates.\n",
    "\t3.\tCross-border law enforcement remains difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Currently, the primary methods to reduce fraud risks include: raising user awareness of different fraud schemes (most important), followed by multi-factor authentication (MFA), and then regular updates to fraud prevention and detection technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rise of RegTech demonstrates that regulators, not just fraudsters, are also innovating by leveraging technology to reduce costs, improve transparency, and enhance compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition, with regard to cross-border fraud, I believe it is essential to strengthen global collaborative law enforcement in the future."

    "-  I defined a class `WikipediaScraper`, with function `scrape_article` to scrape single article, and function `scrape_multiple` to call scrape_article multiple times. It's responsible for scraping and cleaning data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented retry logic and request throttling to avoid failures or blocking; `_validate_article` detects soft 404s, disambiguation pages, and thin content to ensure data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `clean_content` method removes references, footnotes, and footer noise, keeping only the main text. `_extract_title_from_markdown` ensures every record has a valid title.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returns structured results containing both status and invalid_reason, making it easier for subsequent batch processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structure Data Extraction\n",
    "- The 8 fields include tech_name, summary (a general introduction of the technology), evolution_timeline (with year and event, used to trace the evolution of the technology); key_innovations and contributors are designed to answer the questions listed in the Assignment 1 PDF document; applications, challenges, and mitigations are fields that I am particularly interested in, and they also facilitate subsequent comparisons between technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `StructuredExtractor` is dedicated to converting scraped text into structured data that conforms to the Pydantic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Designed `_classify_api_error` and `_compute_backoff` to automatically retry on timeout or rate-limiting errors, while stopping immediately for parameter or authentication errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `_build_prompt` method explicitly defines schema fields to ensure model outputs align with TechInnovationExtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Function Calling\n",
    "- First perform _normalize_phrase to get a strict intersection, then apply Sentence-Transformer embeddings + cosine similarity for fuzzy matching, balancing precision and semantics, and revealing commonalities and differences between two technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a similarity threshold (e.g., 0.68) as a parameter to balance recall and precision; unmatched items are output separately to A_only_fuzzy / B_only_fuzzy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `_index_by_name / _normalize_phrase / _soft_pairs_semantic / dim_soft_semantic` decouple indexing, normalization, pairing, and dimensional aggregation, which makes unit testing and maintenance easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle empty lists or missing fields safely (`_as_list`), return clear error messages (ok=False) when no matches are found, and gracefully degrade when embedding fails or yields empty sets.\n"

    "### 6.3 Challenges faced and solutions implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Difficulty recognizing semantically similar phrases**  \n",
    "   *Challenge*: Phrases like *“Online marketplace transactions”* and *“E-commerce transactions”* have similar meanings but were too different for exact matching.  \n",
    "   *Solution*: Introduced **Sentence-Transformer embeddings** with a cosine similarity threshold (e.g., 0.68) to capture semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantically close phrases still not matched after using embeddings**  \n",
    "   *Challenge*: Items such as *“Public awareness campaigns”*, *“Educating users on security best practices”*, *“User awareness and susceptibility”*, *“User education and training”* are all related to user education/awareness but did not cluster automatically.  \n",
    "   *Solution*: Implemented a `_normalize_phrase` function with regex rules (e.g., if the phrase contains education|educat|awareness, map all to *“User Education & Awareness”*) to unify categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Noisy or overly long content affecting extraction stability**  \n",
    "   *Challenge*: Some Wikipedia articles were too long and contained noise (e.g., References sections, [edit] markers), reducing extraction quality.  \n",
    "   *Solution*: Enhanced `clean_content` to trim text, remove footnotes and redundant sections, and keep only the main body for more stable extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling invalid or disambiguation pages**  \n",
    "   *Challenge*: Some Wikipedia links led to disambiguation pages (lists of links) or non-existent pages, which still returned scraped text.  \n",
    "   *Solution*: Added validation in `WikipediaScraper._validate_article` to detect soft-404/disambiguation signals, filter out invalid data, and record invalid_reason for transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **tech_name changes each time**\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Challenges*: the tech_name of Regulatory Technology will change each time, either Regulatory Technology or Regulatory Technology (RegTech).\n",
    "   *Solution*: add \"use ONLY the article title exactly as given (do not include aliases or parentheses\" for tech_name in Pydantic model.\n"

    "### 6.4 What meaningful patterns or connections did your assistant uncover?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the conversations in **4.4**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Card Fraud vs. Internet Fraud**: Both share challenges around the increasing sophistication of fraud and emphasize **User Education & Awareness**.  \n",
    "  - However, Credit Card Fraud leans on industry standards and compliance (PCI DSS, transaction monitoring), while Internet Fraud relies more on cross-platform collaboration and secure payment practices.  \n",
    "  - This illustrates a pattern of “common defenses + domain-specific governance.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RegTech** rapidly evolved from concept (2014) to institutional endorsement (2015), showing it was policy- and regulator-driven from the start rather than purely market-led.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shared vs. unique mitigations**: Many technologies emphasize **User Education & Awareness** as a universal defense, while others (e.g., Credit Card Fraud) highlight industry-specific standards such as **EMV** and **PCI DSS**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evolving attacker–defender dynamics**: Timelines show a “two-sided innovation” loop—fraud tactics become more sophisticated (e.g., phishing → AiTM), and defenses escalate in response (e.g., MFA, real-time monitoring, RegTech).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-domain collaboration**: Contributors include regulators, banks, tech companies, and researchers, suggesting that fraud prevention is not purely technical but requires multi-stakeholder cooperation."
